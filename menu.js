	static helpPlayingMoveB1 = 'üÖ±Ô∏è Type a move in SAN\n\nStandard Algebraic Notation (SAN) is used to describe where a piece has moved to, for each turn in a chess game.\n\nMoves are usually denoted by the piece letter (e.g. R for rook) and the destination square (e.g. Rb1 moves the rook to the b-file on the first rank). Pawn moves are an exception, as they are described using only the destination square (e.g. e4 moves the pawn to the e-file on the fourth rank).\n\nü§ì says: Remember that \'K\' is for King, while \'N\' is for kNight!';
	static helpPlayingMoveB2 = 'Captures are denoted with an "x" written before the destination square. For example, Rxb1 refers to the rook capturing a piece on the b1 square, while exd5 refers to the pawn on the e-file capturing a piece on the d5 square. (ü§ì adds: SAN is case sensitive - piece letters are uppercase and coordinates are lowercase!)\n\nIn EmojiChess, checks (+) and checkmates (#) do not need to be included in the notation when typing a move. Also, castling is denoted using the letter \'O\', e.g. O-O for king side castling.\n\nFor a full breakdown of algebraic notation, such as how to disambiguate moves for two identical pieces, check out the Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)';
